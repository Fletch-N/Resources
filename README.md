## Folder Structure

### Organizational Patterns

- Category-based structure for main folders (data, docs, examples, etc.)
- Subfolders for further organization within categories (e.g., design subfolders within docs)
- Language/Technology specific subfolders where applicable (e.g., .NET examples)

### Subfolders

**Data:** The data folder stores raw and processed datasets, used in various projects
- Datasets: Raw data files
- Processed: Files prepared and ready for analysis

**Docs:**  Various documentation, including cheatsheets, design guides, tutorials, and notes.
- Cheatsheets: Quick reference guides for specific topics
- Design: Gathering of design documents organized as follows
  - `System Design:` Documents outlining the overall structure and components of systems, including high-level architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, and component interaction specifications.
  - `Software Design:` Specifications related to the software development process, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and detailed descriptions of software modules.
  - `Architecture:` Diagrams and documents that define the high-level structure of systems and software, including infrastructure design, communication protocols, and technology stack specifications.
- Guides: In-Depth tutorials and explanations
- Notes: Summaries on articles, research, etc.

**Examples:** Code examples and snippets implementing specific techniques or integrations.
- .NET
- Bash
- FFMPEG
- Powershell
- TypeScript

**Media:** Relevant recordings, diagrams, images, and videos.
- Audio: Audio recordings, podcasts, or sample assets
- Video: Video tutorials, demonstrations, or recordings
- Diagrams: Flowcharts, UML diagrams, and other visual aids
- Images: Screenshots, illustrations, and other graphical assets

**Misc:** Files that don't fit neatly into other categories.

**Templates:** Reusable scaffolding for coding, reports, and presentations.

**Tools:** Custom scripts and third-party tools.

- Third-Party: Third party libraries, plugins, or tools

## File Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and clear names that reflect the content of the file.
- Separate words with underscores (snake_case).
- Use lowercase letters for filenames.
- Consider including version numbers or timestamps for iterative files (e.g., data_analysis_v1.csv, conference_notes_2023-05-31).
